<p>Using the Senator's Official Stationary:</p>
	<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
	<p>I, Congressman Brian Schatz, was approached by Ryan Pace Sloan regarding his desire to lower energy costs in
		Hawaii using a USDA Federal Grant. He briefly explained his mission and his strategy to address high energy costs
		using that money. I support him in his pursuit of the grant. His vision for energy and his mission are in line
		with the State of Hawaii's and we welcome someone who wants to come and help our community.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p style="color: red">Please have the senator sign here.</p>
