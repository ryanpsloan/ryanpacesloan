 	 <h2>Education</h2>

	 <h3 class="indentHeader">Certificate of Completion:  Deep Dive Coding Boot camp - CNM. Albuquerque,
		 NM. December 2014.</h3>
	 <p class="indentText">Under an agile workflow, I co-developed a web-based, customized, enterprise software solution
		 that integrates
	 the technologies of PHP/mySQL, HTML5/CSS3, and JavaScript/JQuery. I worked as part of a team using phpStorm IDE,
	 Version control with Git and Github and an SSH link to the class server to design, build, test and deliver a
	 turnkey application that provided a virtual point of sale for airline flights. The site’s backend involved a
	 relational database created and accessed using mySQL with associated table handling classes written in PHP.
	 We accessed an external API called Stripe to process payments. The front end was designed with HTML5/CSS3,
	 JavaScript/JQuery and Bootstrap. Using the techniques and tools learned through this program I
	 successfully built two live websites independently, as well as a personal website.</p>

	 <h3 class="indentHeader">AAS: CIS - Computer Programming, CNMCC.  Albuquerque, NM. August 2014;</h3>
	 <p class="indentText">During my education at CNM I obtained a detailed, in-depth working knowledge of computer
		 programming in
	 C++, Java,and .NET using the Object Oriented Programming paradigm. I wrote multi-class programs employing inheritance
	 and polymorphism. I programmed algorithms to encode, decode, hash, sort and search data. I employed template
	 classes, memory management principals as well as utilized the OpenGL graphics library to draw and render
	 3-dimensional scenes and objects. I developed good coding style and detailed understanding of coding principals
	 through practical study, implementation, exploration and application of correct coding. I designed database entity
	 relationship diagrams, coded create table statements and inter-table key relationships using an Oracle Database.
	 I studied the commands to insert, select, delete as well as advanced SQL queries. I worked with a live server
	 using Linux commands in both a GUI and command line interface and was exposed to the fundamentals of networking.
	 I also developed strong problem solving skills through extensive practice in debugging and problem solving.</p>

	 <h3 class="indentHeader"> BA: Economics, Guilford College. Greensboro, NC. July 2002;</h3>
	 <p  class="indentText">I used my undergraduate education to sharpen my thinking by studying Economics, Psychology
		 , Philosophy,
		 History, Art, Acting, Music, Photography, History, French, Cultural Anthropology and Chess.</p>
